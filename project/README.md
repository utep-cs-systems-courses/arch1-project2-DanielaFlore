In this lab we were instructed to program the MSP430 to do various functions, which are: play a tune, change LEDs dynamically, and use the buttons.

access: 
       
       go to project directory, run make, then make load.

MSP430 functions:

        once loaded, MSP430 will first start with green and red LEDs illuminated.
        when button one is pressed, green LED will illuminate brightly and play a single note continously. if pressed twice, the green LED will turn off.
        When button two is pressed, the "song" will be played, and when done, red LED will turn on dimly.
        When button three is pressed red LED will illuminate brightly and play a single note continously.is pressed twice red LED will be turned off.
